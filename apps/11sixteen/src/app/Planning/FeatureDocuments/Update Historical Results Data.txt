Step in process
1 Determine the number of missing fixtures per monitored league, per season

    1.1 Build a list of "monitored leagues"
        1.1.1 Open the "leagues" collection
        1.1.2 Filter "leagues" collection where [monitored] = True
        1.1.3 Return "monitored_leagues" object (all available data in "leagues" collection for each "monitored
              league" )

    1.2 Determine the number of available fixture results in "football_results" collection per "monitored league", per
        season
        1.1.1.1 Structure the "available_fixtures" object

        1.1.2.2 Per league in the "monitored_leagues" object
                  2.2.1 Open the "football_results" collection
                  2.2.2 Perform an aggregation on the "football_results" collection that:
                        2.2.2.1 Filters ($match) by country and league name
                        2.2.2.2 Groups the results by season
                        2.2.2.3 Counts the documents per season grouping
                        2.2.2.4 Sorts the groups in order (ascending)

        1.1.3 Determine the number of teams per league per season



4 Per league:
    Determine the APIs that can be called

    4.1 Perform the available API calls

    4.2 Per API response:
        4.2.1 Save the call response to a txt file
        4.2.2 Save that file to Firebase storage
        4.2.3 Per fixture in the API response:
            4.2.3.1 Check if the result is already in the DB, If not:
                4.3.1.1.1 Add that result to the DB
                4.3.1.1.2 Add the document referance to the change log object
