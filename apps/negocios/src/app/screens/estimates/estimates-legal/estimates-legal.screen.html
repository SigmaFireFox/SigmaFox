    Nobody likes legalese, terms, conditions etc, but they are important. They
    protect all parties to a transaction by allowing each to know their rights
    and obligations in relation to that transaction. Now even though we are
    offering this estimate (as well as our desktop valuations) at no cost, some
    serious looking guy in a very expensive suit (our legal council) told us
    that this is a transaction nevertheless. We offer you a service (albeit at
    no cost) and you by giving us your time "compensate us" for our services, so
    it's very important for us to inform your of our terms and conditions
    related to this service...

          This estimates service provides you as the user an estimated range for
          a particular business asset. The service requires a limited amount if
          information input from you as the user and as such our results
          presented as very limited in their actuary and as we as Negocios can
          in no possible way understand a business full in a short online
          process, the results presented are in now way a professional opinion
          and any form or manner. The results are only for interest, informative
          and educational purposes and in now way can ever be considered
          financial or legal advice in any way. You as the user need to
          understand and agree that you can not use the results of this
          estimated process in any way other than for interest, informative and
          educational purposes as for which they are intended.

          We love data - in fact we can’t get enough of the stuff. Data allows
          us to improve our services and ultimately ensure we are keeping up to
          date with the market’s perception of value. But what is more important
          to us is your privacy and your privacy concerns. So we will record
          data that you have not explicitly given us concern to record.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of security, we employ the highest standards of data
          protection we possibly can and use the services of trusted entities to
          help ensure we constantly improve our security protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
          We promise that we will never ever share your data to any third party
          (unless we are legally obliged to) and that any data we do record is
          only used internally by our data scientist locked away in our basement
          somewhere.

          Please feel free to read about our data policy and security protocols
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, would it be okay if we record the inputs and
          results of this estimate once complete?
