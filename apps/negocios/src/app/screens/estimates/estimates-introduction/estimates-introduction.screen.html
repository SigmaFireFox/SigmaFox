    Estimates are a quick and easy way to get a feel for what your business
    could be worth. It requires very little time to complete and is
    uncomplicated in the information it requires to provide that estimate. But
    there are few limitations and we throught it would be good to run you
    through them before we get started.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Estimates only provide an value range not a specific value</span>,
        which means at the end of this process, we will provide you with a two
        values (a lower and upper value) for which your businesses actually
        value is highly likely to fall within. The width of that range depends
        on a variety of factors but as a rule of thumb the more historical
        financial information we have the more accurate we are able to forecast
        and the more likely we are able to provide a narrower estimate range.
        This is a rule of thumb only and not always the case - as we mentioned,
        there are a variety of factors that would affect the estimate range, but
        more information helps. If you are looking for a more precise valuation
        number we recommend performing a desktop valuation instead - they take a
        little longer to complete but are free as well, they only require you to
        create an account with us.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Estimates have a fixed valuation date. </span> The valuation date
        is the date for which a valuation is valid, in the case of this estimate
        process that will be the last day of the financial year end for which
        historical information is provided. If you are looking for a valuation
        at a specific date we recommend performing a desktop valuation instead -
        they take a little longer to complete but are free as well, they only
        require you to create an account with us.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>The forecasts generated are generic. </span>The cornerstone of a
        business' value is that businesses' expected future performance and key
        to perform forecasts. With this estimates process the forecasts are 100%
        generated by our own algorithms, and although are algorithms have been
        developed by some of the brightest minds around, you may not agree with
        the results as there may be a variety of unconsidered factors you may be
        aware that donâ€™t factoring into our forecasts - like a recent contact
        landed or the launch of a new product etc. If you would like to have
        more control over the forecasts on which a valuation is determined we
        recommend performing a full valuation which allows for user adjustments
        to forecasts. Full valuation is a paid for service, but we absolutely
        believe the small fee is worth it.

        <span>Financial history input templates are standard. </span>Every
        business is different and they way each business report their financial
        performance as well as their financial position. Even though financial
        standard such as IFRS and GAAP have gone a long way standardise the way
        business around the world should report their financial results, they
        are extremely complex frameworks which business still continue have
        different implementations of. Further small business (for which a this
        estimate process was specifically designed for are unable to conform to
        such complex accounting frameworks and prefer to keep their accounting
        simple and suited for their own needs as opposed to conforming to
        complex standards. Having said that - this estimate process uses a
        simple financial history input form that will cater for most if not all
        smaller businesses. If you require a more advanced input framework
        because your accounts are more advance and customised then we recommend
        performing a desktop valuation instead - they take a little longer to
        complete but are free as well, they only require you to create an
        account with us.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Estimates can not be edited once complete. </span> This may be
        nasty on our part but the estimate process is not our core focus at
        Negocio. Estimates are a way for us to allow new users to get a feel for
        what our service offering is. So we would ideally like new users to try
        our estimates to see if they like how our flows work and if they do to
        then create and an account with us to take full advantage of our product
        offering. Now if you like free (as we all do), then we recommend
        converting this estimate to a desktop valuation at the end of the
        estimate process. You will be given the option to convert your estimate
        to a desktop valuation and remember desktop valuations are free. But
        remember that once an estimate is complete you will not be able to go
        back and edit inputs for that estimate and you will need to start again
        from the very beginning, but converting your estimate to a desktop is
        simple, free and you will be then be go back and make estimates - you
        will only need to create and account with us.
