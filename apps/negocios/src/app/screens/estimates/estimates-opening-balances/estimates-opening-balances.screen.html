    Almost there, now to address opening balances
  </div>
  <div class="intro-para-container">
    We noticed that you entered a opening retained earnings balance for
    {{firstFinancialYearData.year}}. Based on this we assume that
    {{firstFinancialYearData.year}} was not the first trading year for the
    business in question.
  </div>
  <div class="intro-para-container">
    In order to address this we have three options avaliable to us:
  </div>
  <div class="list-container">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span
            >Option 1: Enter the opening balances for
            {{firstFinancialYearData.year}} (Prefered option)</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          This would be the ideal open for estimate acuracy. If does mean you
          may need to spend 2 minutes entering in the opening balances for
          {{firstFinancialYearData.year}} (or the closing balances for
          {{firstFinancialYearData.year - 1}}). A little painful yes, but the
          benefit or improved estiamte accuaracy may be worth it.
        </p>
        <div class="checkbox-container">
          <mat-checkbox
            [(ngModel)]="optionEnter"
            (change)="amendOptionElected(1)"
            ><span
              >I would prefer to enter the opening balances</span
            ></mat-checkbox
          >
        </div>
        <div *ngIf="optionEnter">
          <app-estimates-opening-balances-form
            [firstFinancialYearData]="firstFinancialYearData"
            [openingBalancesRequested]="$requestOpeningBalanceFormBalances.asObservable()"
            (updatedOpeningBalances)="handleReceivedOpeningBalances($event)"
          >
          </app-estimates-opening-balances-form>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span>Option 2: Assume a zero base (Middle ground)</span></p>
        <p>
          Now this option is not the ideal option but its a fine balance between
          friction and accuaracy. It means we can skip the quick process of
          entering the opening balances and we will perform some clever maths to
          calculate balance movements for the year (assuming all opening
          balances are zero). From that we will be able to provide a cash flow
          statement for {{firstFinancialYearData.year}} - but on the flip side
          {{firstFinancialYearData.year}}'s cash flow statement may have some
          odd looking numbers in it - and those oddities may potentionally have
          an impact on the accuarcy of our estimates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also something to consider is that if you elect at a later stage to
          convert this estimate to a desktop valuation (which is our goal), you
          will need to address the opening balances issues at that point

              >I would like to use {{firstFinancialYearData.year}} financial
              info but skip entering {{firstFinancialYearData.year}}'s opening

          <span
            >Option 2: Ignore {{firstFinancialYearData.year}}'s cash flow all
            together (Least preferred option)</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          This option is our least prefered option as it may have a sever impact
          on our estimates - but even so we will do out best to provide you with
          an as accuarate as possible estimate. The
          {{firstFinancialYearData.year}}'s cash flow are ingnored - but the
          down side is that we are unable to derive benefit from the data you
          have already provided for {{firstFinancialYearData.year}} - which will
          make us very sad.
