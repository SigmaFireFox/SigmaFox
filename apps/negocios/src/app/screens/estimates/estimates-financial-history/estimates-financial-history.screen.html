    This step in the estimate process if the most critical and in order to
    provide you with the most acurate results possible we require the financial
    history of the business in question. Although we try to build in as many
    santity checks as possible - We encourage you to take extra care when
    capturing this financial history as once the results are processed - you
    will not be able to amend this financial history (if there is an error). On
    the following screen there will be a oppertunity to review this information
    one last before we cruch the numbers - but again we encourage you to ensure
    caputured information is as accurate as possible
